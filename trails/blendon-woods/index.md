The trails at Blendon Woods Metro Park consist of three short loops that add up to about five miles of trail.  There are several parking options, but the best place to park is at the nature center parking lot, which provides access to all three loops.

Each loop is distinct.  My favorite is the Overlook/Brookside/Ripple Rock loop.  Technically, this loop is actually three distinct trails, but they all blend together to form one natural loop.  While not particularly difficult, the trails here are definitely narrower and more hilly than the others in the park.  The trail is a mostly hard packed dirt and crushed stone surface, and it winds through wooded terrain.

The Goldenrod Trail is a flat and wide grass trail that goes through fields and meadows.  The Sugarbush trail is similarly wide and flat, but it has a dirt surface and it goes through the woods.  Because the Goldenrod and Sugarbush trails are mostly flat and low lying trails, they do not drain well.  They can get unpleasantly muddy, and are they best avoided if it has recently been wet.  The Overlook/Brookside/Ripple Rock loop drains much better.

Even on the most challenging sections, the trails at Blendon Woods are relatively easy.  But the scenery is pleasant, and 5 miles of off-road trail close to the city is always a nice treat.  Don't travel a long distances to run here, but it's definitely worth trying if you are in the area.
