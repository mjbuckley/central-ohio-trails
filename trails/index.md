### Trail Review Notes and Disclaimers

* All trail distances are approximate and should be treated as a rough guide, not an exact amount.
* All trail directions are to the best of my recollection, but trails change, and I can remember incorrectly.  Always consult an official trail map.
* I use "running trails" to refer to paved trails, and "trail running trails" to refer to unpaved trails.
* I use "biking trails" to refer to both paved trails and to unpaved trails that are gentle enough to be ridden on a road bike.  "Mountain biking trails" are those that require a mountain bike.
* If I think that a park's bike trails are too short to be worth riding, I will omit them from that location's list of activities
