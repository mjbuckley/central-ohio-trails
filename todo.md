## To Do

- BEFORE PUSHING UPDATE: Remove old code. Check on ie/edge. Remove note from calendar. Put note of things to work on somewhere meaningful (maybe along with other code stuff). Figure out issue where transitioning from vertical to horizontal view on small mobile devices results in images being too small for the horizontal screen (they don't stretch to take up the expected width).

- Consider changing the breakpoint for the essential info section to be a bit wider. Many phones don't switch to the mobile view when horizontal and I'm not sure if I like how that looks.
- Add higher quality images. Keep the same cropping, just use higher quality compression.
- See about using Cloudflare as a way of using https on Github pages with my custom domain.
- Maybe make the caption font color a touch darker (this color might be being used elsewhere too and it should be changed everywhere).
- I now have Lato 300. I've used it in a few places, but I think a lot of places could improve by using it.
- Add additional reviews and recheck my current reviews for any changes or additions.
- Add a favicon.
- Run through Google's mobile/page speed test to see if there's anything obvious I should fix that I'm missing.
- Consider ways to improve the trail listing table, esp. for mobile. Also maybe add a simple (clickable?) map showing where the trails are located.
- Improve about page. Make styling nicer, maybe include and image.
- Maybe have images go full width on mobile so I can get them slightly bigger?
- Improve the styling for the additional info section. I did a few things to make it be set off a bit more from the main section, but it could still be improved.
- I've left the hr element that I use above the additional info section unstyled except for margins. Each browser renders it a touch differently, but all that I've seen look similar and fine for now. However, I might consider adding more styles here.
