Clear Creek Metro Park is without a doubt the most physically demanding and technically challenging location for trail running in Central Ohio. Although there are a few flat and easy sections, the majority of the trails here are hilly, steep, and often full of rocks and roots. The hills here have around 400 feet of elevation gain, which for Central Ohio is downright mountainous, and it is significantly more than other hilly locations such as Highbanks (add link). This is the closet trail to Columbus that is considered part of the Hocking Hills region. Although the rock formations are not anywhere near as dramatic as the more well know Hocking Hills parks, there are still many neat rocks along the trails, and the area definatley has a similar feel. It is also much less crowded. It sort of feels like a park that gets forgotten. You'll likley run in to very few people. Maybe a note about how this is about the furthest you can get where I would still call it central ohio (part of trail is in fairfield county) and that the rest of hocking hills feels a bit further.
