The Heritage Rail Trail is a six mile paved trail that starts in downtown Old Hilliard and quickly transitions to the country.  The trail is completely flat, and after briefly passing through suburban neighborhoods and a city park, it is mostly surrounded by scenic meadows and farmland.  

This is an incredibly easy trail to follow.  Other than a few obvious side trails leading into the surrounding neighborhood, it is nearly impossible to get lost.  It's still important to pay attention through, because there are several busy road crossings that can easily sneak up on you.  Cars do not stop at the crossings, so pay careful attention.

About a mile from the trailhead the trail passes Homestead Park.  The park is the only place on the trail with water and restrooms, both located near the blue train car, which is visible from the trail.  The park is also one of two places to park.  The other is at the southern trailhead, located on Center Rd. just north of Main St.

In addition to being enjoyable on its own, the Heritage Rail Trail serves as a great way to access the many road cycling opportunities in the Plain City area.  You can easily bike around the gate blocking the end of the trail in order to access Cemetery Pike Rd.  From here, the roads in this section of town are scenic, well maintained, and relatively uncrowded, and they are well worth exploring.
