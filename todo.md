## To Do

- Did this commit: improve at a glance section, update readme, add a todo.
- RIGHT NOW: Remove old code. Check on ie/edge. Remove note from calendar. Put note of things to work on somewhere meaningful (maybe along with other code stuff). Do something with additional info if it is a quick fix.

- Improve the styling for the additional info section. It needs to be set of a bit more from the main section.
- Consider changing the breakpoint for the essential info section to be a bit wider. Many phones don't switch to the mobile view when horizontal and I'm not sure if I like how that looks.
- Add higher quality images. Keep the same cropping, just use higher quality compression.
- See about using Cloudflare as a way of using https on Github pages with my custom domain.
- Maybe make the caption font color a touch darker (this color might be being used elsewhere too).
- Add additional reviews and recheck my current reviews for any changes or additions.
- Add a favicon.
- Run through Google's mobile/page speed test to see if there's anything obvious I should fix that I'm missing.
- Consider ways to improve the trail listing table, esp. for mobile. Also maybe add a simple (clickable?) map showing where the trails are located.
- Improve about page. Make styling nicer, maybe include and image.
- Maybe have images go full width on mobile so I can get them sligtly bigger?
